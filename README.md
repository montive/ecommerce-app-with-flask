# E-Commerce app developed with Flask

Basic E-commerce app made with Python Flask.

Flask's patterns and extensions used:

* [Python SQLAlchemy](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/patterns/sqlalchemy/): to handle the communication between Python programs and databases.
* [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/): to render and validate web forms in a safe and flexible way in Flask.
* [Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): to handle user session management for Flask.
